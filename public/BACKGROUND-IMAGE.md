# Background Image

Place your background image in this folder named `background.jpg`

## Recommended Specifications:
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Dimensions:** 1920x1080 or higher
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Optimization:** Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress

## Using Your Image:
1. Add your image file to the `public/` folder
2. Name it `background.jpg` (or update the reference in `styles.css` line 26)
3. The CSS already has a gradient overlay for better text readability

## Alternative:
If you prefer a pure gradient background without an image, simply don't add a background image file. The gradient in the CSS will display beautifully on its own.
